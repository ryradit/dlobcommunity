üè∏ DLOB Analytics & Attendance Enhancement - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Summary of Implemented Features

### 1. üèÜ Winner Logic Fix (Completed)
**Problem**: Kevin's 42-37 win was showing as a loss
**Solution**: Enhanced winner determination logic using actual scores
**Implementation**:
- Modified `calculatePerformanceMetrics` to compare `userScore > opponentScore`
- Updated trend calculations to use score-based logic
- Enhanced ranking calculations with proper winner detection
**Result**: Kevin now shows 100% win rate (1W-0L) correctly ‚úÖ

### 2. üìä Automatic Attendance via Match Participation (Completed)
**Problem**: Members who play matches might show low attendance if they forget manual check-in
**Solution**: Match participation automatically counts as attendance
**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `/api/attendance/stats` to include match participation dates
- Updated `calculateAttendanceMetrics` to consider both manual attendance and match dates
- Modified analytics and dashboard to show combined attendance rates
**Result**: Fair and accurate attendance tracking for all members ‚úÖ

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Enhancements
```typescript
// Enhanced Attendance API
GET /api/attendance/stats?member_id=xxx
Response: {
  attendance_rate: 75,           // Combined rate
  total_sessions: 12,            // Total Saturdays
  attended_sessions: 9,          // Manual + Match dates
  manual_attendance: 5,          // Check-in records
  match_participation: 4,        // Matches played
  period: { start_date, end_date }
}
```

### Analytics Logic
```typescript
// Winner Determination (Score-based)
const userWon = userScore > opponentScore;

// Attendance Calculation (Combined)
const attendedDates = new Set([
  ...manualAttendanceDates,
  ...matchParticipationDates
]);
const attendanceRate = attendedDates.size / totalSaturdays * 100;
```

### Frontend Integration
- **Analytics Page**: Real-time performance with correct win/loss indicators
- **Member Dashboard**: Combined attendance rates including match participation
- **Match History**: Proper WIN/LOSS badges based on actual scores
