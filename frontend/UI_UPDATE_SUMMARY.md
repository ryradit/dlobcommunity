Perfect! I've successfully modified the UI structure to efficiently display separate payments with the following improvements:

## ✅ **NEW PAYMENT UI STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTED**

### 🎯 **Key UI Changes Made**

1. **📋 Grouped Payment Display**: Payments are now grouped by member and date instead of individual rows
2. **🏸 Separate Shuttlecock UI**: Orange-themed cards with shuttlecock emoji (🏸) for equipment fees
3. **📅 Separate Session Fee UI**: Green-themed cards with calendar emoji (📅) for attendance fees
4. **🎨 Visual Distinction**: Different colors, icons, and styling for each payment type

### 🎨 **UI Design Features**

#### **Shuttlecock Payments (Orange Theme):**
```
🏸 Shuttlecock Fee
Equipment usage charge
Rp2,250 - PENDING
Actions: [Mark Paid] [Remind]
```

#### **Session Payments (Green Theme):**
```
📅 Session Fee  
Attendance & facility charge
Rp18,000 - PENDING
Actions: [Mark Paid] [Membership] [Daily Rate]
```

### 🔧 **Smart Action Buttons**

- **Shuttlecock Payments**: Only basic actions (Mark Paid, Send Reminder)
- **Session Payments**: Full conversion options (Mark Paid, Convert to Membership, Convert to Daily Rate)
- **No conversion buttons on shuttlecock fees** ✅

### 📱 **Responsive Layout**

- **Desktop**: Side-by-side payment cards
- **Mobile**: Stacked payment cards
- **Grid system**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### 💡 **Benefits of New UI Structure**

1. **🔍 Better Visual Scanning**: Easy to distinguish payment types at a glance
2. **📊 Efficient Queue Display**: One member row contains both payment details
3. **🎯 Focused Actions**: Conversion buttons only where they make sense (session fees)
4. **📱 Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices
5. **💰 Clear Totals**: Payment summary shows combined totals per member

### 🎉 **Implementation Status**

✅ **Admin Payment Management Page**: Updated with grouped payment UI
✅ **Separate Shuttlecock/Session Cards**: Different colors and icons
✅ **Action Button Logic**: Membership conversion only on session fees  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
✅ **Payment Grouping**: Efficient member-based queuing system
✅ **Visual Indicators**: Clear status icons and color coding

The UI now perfectly matches your requirements - **2 separate payment details per member in an efficient queue structure with different UI styling and targeted action buttons!** 🚀

Would you like me to demonstrate this by starting the development server, or would you prefer to see any other specific UI adjustments?
