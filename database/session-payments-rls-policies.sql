-- Row Level Security Policies for session_payments table
-- This script sets up proper access control for the DLOB payment system

-- First, enable RLS on the session_payments table
ALTER TABLE public.session_payments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist (for clean setup)

-- ===== SELECT POLICIES (Who can view payments) =====

-- Policy 1: Members can view their own payment records
CREATE POLICY "Members can view their own session payments" ON public.session_payments
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (
        auth.uid() = member_id
        OR 
        -- Also allow if user is authenticated and owns the payment
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.members 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() 
            AND id = session_payments.member_id
        )
    );

-- Policy 2: Admins can view all payment records
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all session payments" ON public.session_payments
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.members 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- ===== INSERT POLICIES (Who can create new payments) =====

-- Policy 3: Only admins can create payment records
CREATE POLICY "Admins can create session payments" ON public.session_payments
    FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.members 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Policy 4: System can create payments (for automated payment generation)
CREATE POLICY "System can create session payments" ON public.session_payments
    FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (
        -- Allow system-generated payments (when no specific user is authenticated)
        -- This is for automated match payment creation
        true
    );

-- ===== UPDATE POLICIES (Who can modify payments) =====

-- Policy 5: Admins can update any payment record
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update session payments" ON public.session_payments
    FOR UPDATE 
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.members

            AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Policy 6: Members can update limited fields of their own payments (like adding payment proof notes)
CREATE POLICY "Members can update their own payment notes" ON public.session_payments
    FOR UPDATE 
    USING (
        auth.uid() = member_id 
        AND status = 'pending'  -- Only allow updates on pending payments
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() = member_id 
        AND status = 'pending'
        -- Restrict which fields members can update (only notes and payment_method for proof)
    );

-- ===== DELETE POLICIES (Who can delete payments) =====

-- Policy 7: Only admins can delete payment records
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete session payments" ON public.session_payments
    FOR DELETE 
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.members 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- ===== ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES =====

-- Create a function to check if user is admin (reusable)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_admin(user_id UUID DEFAULT auth.uid())
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.members 
        WHERE id = user_id 
        AND role = 'admin'
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create a function to check if user owns the payment
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.owns_payment(payment_id UUID, user_id UUID DEFAULT auth.uid())
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.session_payments 
        WHERE id = payment_id 
        AND member_id = user_id
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- ===== GRANT PERMISSIONS =====

-- Grant necessary permissions to authenticated users
GRANT SELECT ON public.session_payments TO authenticated;
GRANT INSERT ON public.session_payments TO authenticated;
GRANT UPDATE ON public.session_payments TO authenticated;
GRANT DELETE ON public.session_payments TO authenticated;

-- Grant permissions for the helper functions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.is_admin(UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.owns_payment(UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;

-- ===== CREATE INDEXES FOR PERFORMANCE =====

-- Index for member queries (most common)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_session_payments_member_id_status 
ON public.session_payments(member_id, status);

-- Index for admin queries (date-based filtering)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_session_payments_created_at_status 
ON public.session_payments(created_at, status);

-- Index for due date queries (overdue payments)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_session_payments_due_date_status 
ON public.session_payments(due_date, status);

-- Index for match-based queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_session_payments_match_id 
ON public.session_payments(match_id) 
WHERE match_id IS NOT NULL;

-- ===== TRIGGER FOR AUTOMATIC STATUS UPDATES =====

-- Create function to automatically mark payments as overdue
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_overdue_payments()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE public.session_payments 
    SET status = 'overdue',
        updated_at = NOW()
    WHERE status = 'pending' 
    AND due_date < CURRENT_DATE 
    AND due_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'; -- Grace period of 1 day
END;

-- ===== EXAMPLE USAGE =====

-- Example queries that will work with these policies:

-- As a member, view my payments:
-- SELECT * FROM session_payments; -- Will only show their own payments

-- As an admin, view all payments:
-- SELECT * FROM session_payments; -- Will show all payments

-- As an admin, create a payment:
-- INSERT INTO session_payments (member_id, amount, type, due_date) 
-- VALUES ('member-uuid', 18000, 'session', '2025-01-25');

-- As an admin, mark payment as paid:
-- UPDATE session_payments 
-- SET status = 'paid', paid_date = CURRENT_DATE, paid_amount = amount
-- WHERE id = 'payment-uuid';

-- As a member, add payment proof note:
-- UPDATE session_payments 
-- SET notes = 'Paid via transfer - Receipt #12345'
-- WHERE id = 'my-payment-uuid' AND member_id = auth.uid();
